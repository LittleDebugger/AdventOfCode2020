# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 puzzles

The solution files have been cleaned up a little (removed comments & excess prints, fixed formatting)
 but the logic remains the same as they was when each answer was submitted. 

I learned Python in 2020 only to improve my times on AoC. I don't think it helped a lot, if any...

My ranks in the first few are in the 100's so I can come up with a solution and code it quite fast.
I think the main reason why I do not achieve consistency low ranks is because I always introduce 
small bugs due to rushing.
These bugs are easy to find and fix individually but, for each additional bug, the cost is exponential. 
So, with more complex problems there are more bugs (obviously).
In 2021 I will concentrate on coding fewer bugs (also in a professional capacity :-D)
